Hi repo viewers! This is the repo for my undergrad class Machine Learning.  
In this class, I did some ML algorithm implementation projects like K Means, Gradient Decent, and Kernal Method.  
There are also some projects that used ML techniques to explore real world data problems such as California Housing Price Prediction and Music Generation.  
The final project was a Graduate Program Recommendation System that provides personalized recommendations based on users attributes like major, GPA, GRE score, etc.  
Techniques like Word Embedding, K Nearest Neighbors, and DenseNet pre-trained model were used.
